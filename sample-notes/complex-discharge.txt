Chief Complaint:
Progressive dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity swelling, and fatigue over two weeks.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history significant for chronic systolic heart failure (EF 30%), permanent atrial fibrillation on apixaban, chronic kidney disease stage 3b, type 2 diabetes mellitus, COPD, and hyperlipidemia. She presented to the emergency department with worsening shortness of breath, orthopnea, and 10-pound weight gain over two weeks. She denied fever or chest pain but admitted to increased salt intake and missed doses of her loop diuretic due to nausea.

Emergency Department Course:
- Vitals: BP 156/92, HR 108 (irregular), RR 24, SpO2 90% on room air, afebrile.
- Labs: BNP 2350 pg/mL, troponin negative x2, creatinine 1.8 mg/dL (baseline 1.5), BUN 45 mg/dL, sodium 133 mEq/L, potassium 4.8 mEq/L, HbA1c 8.2%.
- Imaging: CXR with pulmonary vascular congestion and small bilateral pleural effusions; bedside ultrasound notable for B-lines and dilated IVC.
- EKG: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (HR 110), no ST changes.
- Management: Given IV furosemide 80 mg, started on supplemental O2 2 L nasal cannula, rate control with IV diltiazem bolus (later transitioned to metoprolol). Admitted to telemetry for acute decompensated heart failure.

Hospital Course:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: Diuresed with IV furosemide 80 mg BID, resulting in net negative 4.2 L over 72 hours and 8-pound weight loss. Transitioned to oral torsemide 40 mg daily at discharge. Entresto resumed once blood pressure stabilized. Repeat transthoracic echo unchanged (EF 30%, global hypokinesis).
2. Persistent atrial fibrillation with RVR: Metoprolol succinate increased to 150 mg daily for rate control (HR goal <95). Continued apixaban 5 mg BID. No cardioversion attempted due to ongoing congestion.
3. Acute kidney injury on CKD3b: Likely cardiorenal; creatinine peaked at 2.1 mg/dL, improved to 1.7 mg/dL with diuresis. ACE inhibitor withheld; to resume with close outpatient monitoring.
4. COPD: Mild wheezing treated with scheduled nebulized bronchodilators; no steroids required. Home tiotropium continued.
5. Diabetes mellitus type 2: Basal-bolus insulin regimen adjusted (glargine 28 units nightly, lispro 6 units TID with meals). Sliding scale used for coverage. Endocrinology recommended addition of SGLT2 inhibitor for heart failure benefit; to be initiated outpatient once renal function stable.
6. Hyponatremia: Mild and responsive to fluid restriction (1.5 L/day).
7. Vaccinations: Received influenza and pneumococcal vaccines prior to discharge.

Consultations:
- Cardiology: Recommended close outpatient follow-up within 1 week, enrollment in remote CHF monitoring program, and assessment for ICD candidacy.
- Nutrition: Low-sodium (<2 g/day), fluid-restricted diet counseling; provided patient education materials.

Discharge Medications (changes bold):
- **Torsemide 40 mg PO daily** (replaced furosemide)
- Metoprolol succinate 150 mg PO daily (increased)
- Sacubitril/valsartan 49/51 mg PO BID (restart)
- Spironolactone 12.5 mg PO daily
- Apixaban 5 mg PO BID
- Empagliflozin 10 mg PO daily (**new**)
- Insulin glargine 28 units SQ nightly
- Insulin lispro 6 units SQ TID with meals + supplemental sliding scale
- Atorvastatin 40 mg PO nightly
- Tiotropium inhaler 2 puffs daily
- Albuterol inhaler PRN
- Omeprazole 20 mg PO daily

Discharge Disposition:
Home with visiting nurse services for daily weights, medication reconciliation, and reinforcement of diet/fluid restrictions. Provided digital scale and instructed to log weights and symptoms using patient portal.

Follow-Up:
- Cardiology clinic within 7 days
- Primary care in 10 days for renal function labs and diabetes management
- Heart failure education class scheduled for next month
- Remote monitoring nurse to contact patient within 48 hours.
